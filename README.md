# Hello React!

[React](https://reactjs.org) is a popular UI library for building web apps, usually single page apps. 

While you're in the editor working, Glitch is running your `start` script in the background. While you develop your application, your changes will happen ü™Ñ immediately in the preview window, or if you've opened it in another tab. 

Once you close the window and your remix goes to sleep, Glitch runs the `build` script. 

## What's in this project?

‚Üê `README.md`: That‚Äôs this file, where you can tell people what your cool website does and how you built it.

‚Üê `index.html`: This is the main page template React uses to build your site. When you're ready to share it or add a custom domain, change SEO/meta settings in here.

‚Üê `src/`: This folder contains all the files React will use to build your site.

### Working in the `src/` folder üìÅ

‚Üê `src/app.jsx`: Your React app!! You can see the language strings, and the click event to change it. 

‚Üê `src/index.jsx`: This is the root of your React app. If you add libraries like [chakra-ui](https://chakra-ui.com) or [redux](https://react-redux.js.org), you'll insert their providers here.

‚Üê `src/styles/styles.css`: CSS files add styling rules to your content.
