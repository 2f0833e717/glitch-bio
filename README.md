# Hello Links!

Your links, your way. A link-in-bio app you can customize any way you want.

## What's in this project?

← `README.md`: That’s this file. You can delete it, or keep it handy so you don't lose the instructions.

← `index.html`: This is the main page template vite uses to build your site. 

← `settings.json`: Settings for your name, image, and links.

← `layout/`: Markup templates — you can edit every line of HTML or never even look at any of it. 

← `styles/`: Stylesheets for Hello Links, including alternate themes.

### Working with Hello Links

To get started open `settings.json` and add your name, avatar, social accounts, and links. Your changes
will all be reflected instantly. 

To help you make it your own we've included multiple themes. Open `index.html` and look for the first
comment, which starts with `<!--- THEMES:` to see where to make a change. Choose any theme you want, or
start with one of them and make your own. 

We've also included a few `<!--- NEXT STEPS: ` comments that show things like adding a bio paragraph or 
embedding a YouTube video.
