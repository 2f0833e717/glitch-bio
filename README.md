# Hello Links!

Your links, your way. A link-in-bio app you can customize any way you want.

🚀 **TL;DR Remix and edit `settings.json` to add your own links!** 🚀


### Working with Hello Links

To get started, open `settings.json` and add your name, avatar, social accounts, and links. Your changes will all be reflected instantly. 

To help you make the site your own we've included multiple themes. In `settings.json` you can choose `glitch` or `gallery`. In `index.html` the first comment, which starts with `<!--- THEMES:` shows you where the theme is added to the page. Choose any theme you want, add a new one, or start with one and edit it to make it your own. _If you don't have a valid theme selected the site will default to the styles outlined in `style.css`._

We've also included a few `<!--- NEXT STEPS: ` comments in the HTML that show things like adding a bio paragraph or embedding a YouTube video. 


## What's in this project?

← `README.md`: That’s this file. You can delete it, or keep it handy so you don't lose the instructions.

← `index.html`: This is the main page template vite uses to build your site. You'll find the handlebars syntax for importing the data you specify in `settings.json` using the structures in `layout/` in here. You'll also find some tips on configuring the page in the HTML comments.

← `settings.json`: Settings for your name, image, and links. The `index.html` page includes the data in the structures defined in `layout/`.

← `layout/`: Markup templates — you can edit every line of HTML or never even look at any of it. The data you specify in `settings.json` will be built into the page using the HTML in here.

← `public/styles/`: Stylesheets for Hello Links, including alternate themes. Change your theme in `index.html`.

← `public/manifest.json` and `public/sw.js`: These set your site up to function as a Progressive Web App (PWA).

← `assets`
